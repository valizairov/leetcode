/*
 5. Longest Palindromic Substring - Medium
 Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

 Example 1:
 Input: s = "babad"
 Output: "bab"
 Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
 
 Example 2:
 Input: s = "cbbd"
 Output: "bb"
 
 Approach 1:
    Find the number of occurrences for each character.
    Calculate the maximum match for each character
    If the result is less than the original string length, we can add one character to the maximum result's center.

class Solution {
    func longestPalindrome(_ s: String) -> String {
        return ""
    }
}
